## Objectives

- Ability to understand the role Constructors play in JavaScript.
- Be able to create flexible functions that can serve a variety of data

## Normal Mode

1. Copy [this file](https://gist.github.com/overthemike/d54ccf901476ea6e8509) and name it `constructors.js`.
2. You'll be ONLY adding code to the (`constructors`) area of the `constructors.js`, leave the rest of the code alone
3. Your goal is to make sure all of the tests pass
4. To see what that looks like, refer to the `final.png` screenshot below:

2. Deploy to github pages
